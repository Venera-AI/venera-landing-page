# Venera AI - Landing Page

This project is used to create the landing page for Venera AI Healthcare. At Venera AI, we're dedicated to transforming healthcare with cutting-edge AI technologies. The landing page shows public information such as our work, team, and vision for the future of healthcare.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

It is recommended to use [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as the package manager for this project. It should already be installed along with Node.

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Scripts

- `pnpm lint`: Lint the code using ESLint and Prettier.
- `pnpm lint:fix`: Try to fix lint errors using ESLint and format the code using Prettier.

## Contributing

The repository enforces ESLint and Prettier to ensure code format and quality. Your code is also automatically linted and formatted using ESLint and Prettier when you commit your changes. In the case linting errors are not fixed automatically, please run `pnpm lint` to find the errors and fix them manually.

### Feature Work

TODO Write a Wiki page on how to contribute to the project.
